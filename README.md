# ConnectFour
This is a Python implementation of Connect Four, using the Terminal for a local gameplay. It's just a simple and fun project that I enjoyed building.

You can also find the source code on [replit](https://replit.com/@nick0101/Connect-Four?v=1), where I originally wrote the code. Here follows a gif of an actual quick gameplay:
